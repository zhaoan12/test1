# 38-Simulence
​
Tasks are managed on a Github project.

## Partner Intro
Simulence offers user research for your games, allow for easy, cost effective, and customizable playtesting

Our primary point of contact is Sam Nulf, the manager for the Simulence project.

## Description about the project

Simulence is a web-app designed for game developers to obtain feedback on their games that they upload to it, from a user base of playtesters. 
The ideas is that the web app will provide a platform so that indie game developers can use it as a form of QA testing through surveys, reviews, and possibly streamed gameplay.
​
## Key Features

Developers would be able to: 
 * Upload games for playtesters to download and play
 * Create and distribute surveys for playtesters
 * Manage their own developer account
 * Interact with playtesters by adding them to their game, or read and reply to reviews
 * Schedule events with a calendar

Playtesters would be able to:
 * Manage their playtester account
 * Interact with games by adding reviews and filling surveys

Administrators would be able to:
 * Manage the subscription service for users
 * Enforces rules on the web-app

## Instructions
 * Clear instructions for how to use the application from the end-user's perspective
 * How do you access it? For example: Are accounts pre-created or does a user register? Where do you start? etc. 
 * Provide clear steps for using each feature described in the previous section.
 * This section is critical to testing your application and must be done carefully and thoughtfully.

## Deployment and Github Workflow
​
Describe your Git/GitHub workflow. Essentially, we want to understand how your team members share codebase, avoid conflicts and deploys the application.
​
 * Be concise, yet precise. For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Describe your overall deployment process from writing code to viewing a live application
 * What deployment tool(s) are you using? And how?
 * Don't forget to **briefly justify why** you chose this workflow or particular aspects of it!

## Coding Standards and Guidelines

We will be publishing pull requests each time we commit to the project, and upon each pull request, we will conduct thorough reviews on each pull request. 
​
## Licenses 
​
​ We will applying the MIT license, or in other words:

 * We will only share the code under an open-source license with the partner but agree to not distribute it in any way to any other entity or individual. Our partner can use it however he likes pretty much without necessarily having to give us anything. We can also put it on our resume and show the code we each wrote individually to employers.

 Note that this licence has no effect on our development process and codebase.
