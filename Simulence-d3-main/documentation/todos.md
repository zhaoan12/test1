# Things To Do

NOTE: This is a legacy document from the Fall 2022 teams (with some changes).

### 1. Enhanced UI/UX & Changed Workflow
The current UI/UX differs a lot from the Figma wireframe. If you want to diagnose what must change and bring it to action, it must be done quickly in the early phase of the process.

The Winter 2023 team has started on this process, but it is not yet complete.

### 2. Deciding Admin Roles 
The current role of an admin-type user is ambiguous and unknown. I highly recommend discussing with the partner the meaning and the allowed actions of an admin. Then, based on the new definition of an admin, I recommend redesigning the entire admin interface. 

### 3. More To Do
- Replacing hard-coded data in AttributeEdit.vue with DB data (refer to Firestore.getFilter() method in GameDetail-Testers.vue)
- Fixing Timeslot feature in GameTester.vue
- Fixing Calendar feature in Calendar.vue
- Categorizing the vue files into subfolders. 
- Other things mentioned in `/documentation/frontend.md`
