# 38-Simulence
​
Tasks are managed on a Github project.

## Partner Intro
Simulence offers user research for your games, allow for easy, cost effective, and customizable playtesting

Our primary point of contact is Sam Nulf, the manager for the Simulence project.

## Description about the project

Simulence is a web-app designed for game developers to obtain feedback on their games that they upload to it, from a user base of playtesters. 
The ideas is that the web app will provide a platform so that indie game developers can use it as a form of QA testing through surveys, reviews, and possibly streamed gameplay.
​
## Key Features

Developers would be able to: 
 * Upload games for playtesters to download and play
 * Create and distribute surveys for playtesters
 * Manage their own developer account
 * Interact with playtesters by adding them to their game, or read and reply to reviews
 * Schedule events with a calendar

Playtesters would be able to:
 * Manage their playtester account
 * Interact with games by adding reviews and filling surveys

Administrators would be able to:
 * Manage the subscription service for users
 * Enforces rules on the web-app

## Instructions
 * Clear instructions for how to use the application from the end-user's perspective
 * How do you access it? For example: Are accounts pre-created or does a user register? Where do you start? etc. 
 * Provide clear steps for using each feature described in the previous section.
 * This section is critical to testing your application and must be done carefully and thoughtfully.
 
 ## Development requirements
 
To use Simulence, users can type the url into their web browser and begin by creating their profile.

## Deployment and Github Workflow
​
Our Github workflow revolves around utilizing the branch system. We will be using multiple branches to track developer progress and updates, conducting efficient and motonomous code reviews as needed. Through the branch system, codebases will be shared and used to avoid conflicts when pushing to the master branch, or in other words, updating the final version of the web app which will deploy. We will adapt basic naming conventions including capital constants and lowercase variables. The process of deployment includes merging branches to form our master branch, which we will then deploy onto the web using a website hosting device. This workflow looked pleasing to us as it is common practice in many of the companies that our group members have experience with, as well as the organizational tool that we use for personal projects.

## Coding Standards and Guidelines

We will be publishing pull requests each time we commit to the project, and upon each pull request, we will conduct thorough reviews on each pull request. 
​
## Licenses 
​
​ We will applying the MIT license, or in other words:

 * We will only share the code under an open-source license with the partner but agree to not distribute it in any way to any other entity or individual. Our partner can use it however he likes pretty much without necessarily having to give us anything. We can also put it on our resume and show the code we each wrote individually to employers.

 Note that this licence has no effect on our development process and codebase.
